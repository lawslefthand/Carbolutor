# Carbolutor
Arduino based envoronmental conscious planner.

A simple task and activity planner with an integrated I2C LCD which can be used to plan a day,weekend or an entire month. It has 4 switches for navigating a self-made custom menu from which different tasks can be selected and from which it can also be seen the timeframe in which they need to be completed. One additional feature is the display of emission data for each particular activity as this mini project is intended for my Uni's Environmental Informatics course.
